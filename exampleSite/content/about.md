this is an example site for the claude noir theme for hugo. it is very customizable.

claude noir is a minimal, dark-themed blog theme focused on clean typography and fast load times. there's no javascript — just simple html and css. it includes features like series navigation for multi-part posts, social icons, reading time estimates, and multiple post list styles. customize the colors, fonts, and layout by editing a few css variables or overriding styles in your own stylesheet.
